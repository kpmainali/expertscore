# expertscore

This packages computes score of an expert map based on its congruence with probability surface of a species distribution model. 

We developed a quantitative metric (“expert score”) to evaluate the agreement between an expert map and a habitat probability surface obtained from a species distribution model (SDM). This method rewards both the avoidance of unsuitable sites and the inclusion of suitable sites in the expert map. 


Map topology was the primary predictor of expert performance rather than any factor related to species characteristics, such as mobility.   Given the heterogeneity and discontinuity of suitable landscape, expert maps that are drawn with more detail are more likely to agree with SDMs and thus minimize both commission and omission errors.
